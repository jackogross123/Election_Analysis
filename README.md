# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections Employee was given the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Find the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election shows that:
- There were 369,711 votes that were casted in the ballot.
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The Candidate Results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham recieved 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 votes.
    - Diana DeGette recieved 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane recieved 3.1% of the vote and 11,606.
- The winner of the election was Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.

## Challenge Overview
The purpose of the challenge was to built on the PyPoll.py code to find out different voting patterns by country in Colorado. The challenge was to print out the county voter turnout in the terminal and also in the election_analysis.txt file. The individual tasks of the challenge are below.

1. Create a county list and a county votes dictionary.
2. Track the largest county turnouts.
3. Add 1 in the county_votes dictionary every time the county name appeared in a row. If the county had not been in the county_list then the county_name was added to the county_votes dictionary. 
4. Write a loop to print the county_results which included the county name, the percentage of ballots that were casted from that county out of the total votes that were casted in the election, and the amount of votes that were casted in that county in the election_analysis text file and in the terminal.
5. Write an if statement that determined the winning county and its vote count.
6. Write a loop to print the name of the county that had the largest turnout to print on the election_analysis text file and in the terminal.

## Challenge Summary
The analysis of the challenge shows that:
- The counties in the election were:
    - Jefferson
    - Denver
    - Arapahoe
- There were 369,711 votes that were casted in the ballot.
- The county results were:
    - Jefferson: 10.5% of the vote and 38,855 votes.
    - Denver: 82.8% of the vote and 306,055 votes.
    - Arapahoe: 6.7% of the vote and 24,801 votes.
- The county with the largest turnout was Denver with 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes. 

By building onto my code I was able to calculate the voter turnout for each county, calculate the percentage of votes that were casted in each candidate, and find the county that had the largest voter turnout.
